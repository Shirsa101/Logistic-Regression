In this project we have data from an airline company. The airline is interested in knowing if a better in-flight entertainment experience leads 
to higher customer satisfaction. We have constructed and evaluated a model that predicts whether a future customer would be satisfied 
with their services given previous customer feedback about their flight experience.

The data for this activity is for a sample size of 129,880 customers. It includes data points such as class, flight distance, and in-flight 
entertainment, among others. The goal is to utilize a binomial logistic regression model to help the airline model and better understand this 
data.
